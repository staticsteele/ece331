Steele Muchemore-Allen ECE 331 Homework #01


1. Vim tutorial was completed. 

2. The Linux Kernel Coding Style was reviewed and will be conformed to.

3. 
  a) 
    /*
	*Program will print all passed
 	*command line arguments. 
 	*/


	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdint.h>

	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{	

			uint32_t count;
			for(count=0; count<argc; count++)
					printf("argv[%d]: %s\n",count,argv[count]);
		
			return 0;
	}	

  b) # ./args "it's The end 0f the world @s we know It.mp3" `ls *[[\]\&\-]*` 

4.
	/*
	*Program that returns the length of single command line argument
	* as string of a's. Returns error if # of args != 1 is passed
	*/

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdint.h>
	#include <string.h> 

	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{
			if(argc == 1) {
					printf("Usage: %s count\n",argv[0]);
					return 1;
			}	
			if(argc > 2) {
					printf("Pass only one argument.\n");
					return 1;
			}	

			uint32_t len;
			len = strlen(argv[1]);
			printf("%d\n",len);

			return 0;
	}

5. The following code and command were used to determine longest single
passable argument.

	//Program that will print user specified # of a's

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdint.h>
	#include <stdlib.h> 



	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{
			if(argc == 1) {
					printf("Usage: %s count\n",argv[0]);
					return 1;
			}
			if(argc > 2) {
					printf("Pass only one argument.\n");
					return 1;
			}	

			uint32_t len, c;
			len = atoi(argv[1]);
	
			for(c = 0; c < len; c++)
					printf("a");
		
			return 0;
	}

# ./strlen `./makestr 131072` returned an error while using 131071 did not.
This means a string of 131071 characters is the longest single passable argument.

6. 
	a) The /usr directory is for all system-wide read-only files that the OS
	installs. 
	
	b) The /bin directory contains all command binaries that are needed
	for booting. We can expect to find our applications in there as a user. 

7. SSH key was generated and added to ECE gitlab. 

8. INSTALL file was followed and dfu-util was built from source. 

9. Homework was printed with 'enscript'.
